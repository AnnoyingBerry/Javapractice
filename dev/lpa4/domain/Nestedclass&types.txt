**** Nested Type
**** Nested Classes
	*** Might want to use nested classes when classes are tightly coupled
		meaning their functionality is interwoven
	
	*** Static Nested Class
		- has advantage of being able to access private attributes on outer class
		- the outer class and access any attributes on the static nested class(inner class)
			including private attributes
		- you dont need getter methods
	
	*** Inner class
		- non-static clase declared at member level of an enclosing class
		- can have any of the 4 access modifiers, default is private
		- have access to instance members, including private members of the enclosing class(outer)

		Syntax to create an instance of an inner class:

			EnclosingClass outerClass = new EnclosingClass();
			EnclosingClass.InnerClass innerclass = outerClass.new InnerClass();
