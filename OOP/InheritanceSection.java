/*
	** Objects
		real world objects:
			- a computer
			- keyboard
			- microphone
			- sheleves
			- door
		Has 2 major components:
			* State
				- e.g. a computer has 
					- amount of ram
					- operating system
					- hard drive size
					- size of monitor
				- e.g. a ant has
					- the age
					- the conscious state
					- number of legs
					- sleeping or awake
			* Behavior - an action that could be perform by an object
				- e.g. a computer has
					- booting up
					- shutting down
					- beeping, output of sound
					- drawing something on screen
				- e.g. a ant has
					- eating
					- drinking
					- fighting
					- carrying food
	
	** Class - describe as data(fields) and behavious(methods)
		* Class members - field,method or type of dependent element
			* Intance Members - each object may have a different value stored for the fields

			* Static members - only one copy in memory , and this value is associated with the class or template iself
				- cant be dependent on one object state, so it cant reference any instance members
		* Packages - Logical organized groupings of classes
		* Top-level class- only if its define in the source code file , and not enclosed in a code block of another class,type or method

		*Access Modifiers 
			* Public
				- any other class in any package can access this class
			* Private
				- the class is only accessible within the class
			* none declared (default)
				- the class is only accessible within classes and within package
			* Protected
				- allows some classes,subclasses in the same or other packages to have access	
		usually you want to keep all things private

	** Encapsulation
		- bundling behaviour and atrributes on a single object
		- hiding fields, and methods from pubic access (each with degrees of access allowed)
